🌍 Project Title

Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis of Delhi – Environmental & Statistical Study

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing an in-depth analysis of the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi to understand environmental pollution patterns, seasonal variations, and the impact of different pollutants on air quality. The analysis aims to support environmental awareness and help in forming data-driven public health strategies.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze AQI trends in Delhi over time

Study the contribution of major pollutants

Understand seasonal variation in air quality

Perform statistical and visual data analysis

Generate insights for environmental improvement strategies

❓ Research Questions

Which pollutants contribute most to poor AQI levels in Delhi?

How does AQI vary across seasons?

Are there long-term trends in air quality improvement or degradation?

How do geographical and climatic conditions influence AQI?
